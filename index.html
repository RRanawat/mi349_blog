            <p>Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. It was initially started as a search engine
                named Backrub and later on changed their named to Google (thank you!). Search engine remains their core
                product but the company has expanded ever since. They have more than half a dozen products with over 1
                billion users. All of these products have been a great contributor to changing people's lives - Google
                Maps changed the way we navigate, YouTube changed the way we consume content, Google Search changed the
                way we access data! What's interesting is a simple clone of these products is not easy to build even
                now. Think of building Google Maps - how would you go about it? You need to have lots of data about
                roads (and initially to collect this data, Google vans/cars used to roam around the city), you need
                routing algorithms, you need traffic information. All of this required research. Even the products that
                don't have a billion useers, like Google Translate have so much research done behind the scenes. The fun
                fact is Google Translate (today) uses Transformer architecture behind the scenes - the same architecture
                used by ChatGPT (GPT stands for Generate Pretrained Tranformer). This Transformer architecture was also
                introduced by researchers at Google! So, yes, ChatGPT exists because of Google. Think about the great
                work they're still doing as they invest more heavily in AI/ML. Their projects which are not as famous
                are going to change the world forever, like Waymo! Truly, the king of AI Research.

                <h2>The Strong Base of AI - Nvidia</h2>
                <p class="date-author"><time datetime="2024-10-13">October 13, 2024</time> by <b>Rivaan Ranawat</b></p>

            <img src="./images/nvidia-logo.png" alt="NVIDIA Logo" height="300">
            <p>Nvidia was founded by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachaowsky and Curtis Priem in 1993. From 1993 to 1999, they
                did great work, no doubt. They sold more than a million units, introducing processors to render 2D and
                3D images but I believe their greatest hit and what decided their future trajectory was in 1999, when
                they introduced the world to the first GPU ever - GeForce 256 (and also went public at 12$ per share).
                The company has been redefining themselves ever since despite "just" making GPUs. They literally created
                an industry which is the hottest thing of AI right now. GPUs are in demand so much that NVIDIA (legally,
                it is NVIDIA, not Nvidia) is a $3.3T company despite a P/E ratio of 63.26 and only 30,000 employees
                (flex, I was one of them (intern)). This might seem like an extremely hyped company and maybe it is but
                I think there is good reasoning behind this - GPUs are really good at matrix multiplication - They are
                very fast. They allow programmers to code in that general purpose GPU using CUDA. And that's what AI is
                about, matrix multiplication and allowing engineers to have control over their GPUs so that they can
                efficiently use it. No wonder, Nvidia is a go-to for all the major big name tech corporations right now
                - Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Tesla, xAI, Oracle. Each of these GPUs cost more than $30,000 and recently
                Elon Musk announced the completion of building a supercompute cluster using 100,000 of the GPUs (H100)
                in 4 months. Think about it - $3B revenue for Nvidia in 4 months. According to reports, Microsoft is the
                biggest client of Nvidia. And Microsoft owns about 49% of OpenAI - That's why I say Nvidia is the base
                of all AI that's happening! Now, for how long that's going to remain, I don't know. Tesla, I know is
                building their own chip, Amazon too. Google has TPUs which is better at inferencing (getting conclusion)
                and probably even training than a GPU but hardware business is so tough - it's going to take some time
                until someone really replaces Nvidia as they even try to lock the companies in their ecosystem and build
                data centers of their own, knowingly or unknowingly competing with AWS (i guess), Amazon's biggest
                source of revenue. AMD looks good too but they're playing a catchup game and Intel is just out but will
                be interesting to see if they make a comeback.
