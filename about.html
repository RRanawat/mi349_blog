        <p>Hello! I am Rivaan Ranawat, a sophomore Computer Science major at Michigan State University. In my freshman
            year summer, I had the opportunity to intern at NVIDIA, which instilled in me the drive to solve challenging
            problems that exist in the world. If you're wondering why I don't have my picture here, instead an R. That's
            because I run a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RivaanRanawat" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> (subscribe) and this is the logo. I don't know if the logo will change in the future but
            as of now, looks good! I am familiar with these languages: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Dart (Flutter)</li>
            <li>HTML, CSS</li>
